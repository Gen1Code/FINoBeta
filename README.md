# Fractional Integration Custom Theory

A Custom Theory for the mobile game [Exponential Idle](https://conicgames.github.io/exponentialidle/), the API and samples that helped create this come from [here](https://github.com/conicgames/theory-sdk)
To see the theory in game enter this link after pressing the '+' icon in the Custom Theory tab: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gen1Code/FINoBeta/main/FINoBeta.js

This CT is for players who dont have access to the beta version of the game, there is an issue in the current game that is fixed in the beta version however a workaround was used here until the beta becomes an update so that players can compete for the unofficial leaderboard.
